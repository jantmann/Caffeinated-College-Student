Final visualization project for STAT3280 (Data Visualization &amp; Management) at the University of Virginia. I have collected data on myself stretching from hours spent doing various activities each day, coffee consumption, and sleep. I will attempt to visualize these factors, discover any trends present in my lifestyle, and compare to my peers.
